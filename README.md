- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kyle Walters @kwaltersdev

- My primary interest is front-end web development. I am experienced in React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Material-ui (mui), Firebase Firestore (web sdk) and Firebase Auth. PWAs (Progressive Web Applications) excite me, and I am currently working on a social fitness challenge PWA in my free time.

- I also have some experience with back-end development, primarily with the following technologies: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDb and MySQL.

- I am on a search for something exciting and challenging to work on full time, particularly in React.js / TypeScript and preferably a PWA.

- You can reach me at kwaltersdev@gmail.com
