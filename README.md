- 👋 Hi, I’m @kwaltersdev
- 👀 I’m interested in web development. JavaScript in particular. Big fan of TypeScript, React and Node. It's a tossup for me between SQL and NoSQL, but the MERN stack will always have my :heartpulse:.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js and Gatsby.js... Which one is better? I don't know yet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something awesome
- 📫 How to reach me ... You can't
